# hololive_harvest_schedule
This script will on execution look up the schedule for hololive and check which of the streams have already

This is a hobby project, which i wish to make into a discord bot which if you call in your server with the streamers
 name and your local time zone will message you before their stream.

Please use this responsibly so as to not over load their servers or fill up your storage.
Yes, this will make a copy of the page to reduce network overhead.
